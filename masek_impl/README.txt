Introduction
------------
I have made the MATLAB® source code for my system publicly available for research and testing purposes. For details of the underlying scientific principles please download my dissertation, available on the main project page.


Limitations
-----------
The system basically inputs an eye image, and outputs a binary biometric template. Also included is code for calculating the Hamming distance between templates, which is required for matching of templates. I have not included code for storage of templates into a database, and code for determining match performance, although I may make this code available at a later stage.


A database of eye images is available from the Chinese Academy of Sciences at:
